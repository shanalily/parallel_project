# Parallel Programming Project

Our code is included in our submitty submission because we do not seem to have permission to access kratos. 

the clcg4.c/clcg4.h files are reused from homework 4/5.
The simulation.c file is our initial implimentation
The sim_simple.c file is our 2nd implimentation
The sim_interstate.c file our 3rd, final, and working implimentation

To run our code first compile it with 

make onedim

then use mpirun with the given number of ranks with sim as its target.
