abstract = "Travel demand, traffic flow and land-use models are typically modeled in a decoupled way, i.e. each of the components is modeled separately assuming that parameters related to the other components are ﬁxed. Moreover, the models are often developed by different groups for different contexts, requirements, etc. In this paper we present a prototype of a software framework which allows the user to develop an integrated simulation of a transportation system and also to link additional models to the new simulation in a standardized way. We use an agent-based approach as the basis of such a model. Integrated transportation system models allow model users to overcome the limitations of traditional aggregated, independent transportation models, particularly with respect to sensitivity to behavioral aspects of the travelers. Another requirement, which the software is to satisfy, is the interoperability of models developed in the new framework with legacy models. By interoperability we mean, that any component of the of the model can be interchanged by a legacy software and be used for the integrated simulation. This would allow disparate research groups working on modeling different aspects of a transportation model to plugnplay their models into the framework and test those as a part of an integrated model of an entire system, providing a beneﬁt to researchers, modelers and institutional users of such models."

    abstract = { Traffic simulation is an important tool for modeling the operations of dynamic traffic systems. Although microscopic simulation models provide a detailed representation of the traffic process, macroscopic and mesoscopic models capture the traffic dynamics of large networks in less detail but without the problems of application and calibration of microscopic models. This paper presents a hybrid mesoscopic–microscopic model that applies microscopic simulation to areas of specific interest while simulating a large surrounding network in less detail with a mesoscopic model. The requirements that are important for a hybrid model to be consistent across the models at different levels of detail are identified. These requirements vary from the network and route choice consistency to the consistency of the traffic dynamics at the boundaries of the microscopic and mesoscopic submodels. An integration framework that satisfies these requirements is proposed. A prototype hybrid model is used to demonstrate the application of the integration framework and the solution of the various integration issues. The hybrid model integrates MITSIMLab, a microscopic traffic simulation model, and Mezzo, a newly developed mesoscopic model. The hybrid model is applied in two case studies. The results are promising and support both the proposed architecture and the importance of integrating microscopic and mesoscopic models. }
